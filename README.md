# PID-Tuning-with-RL
This project uses reinforcement learning (RL) to tune PID controllers for a nonlinear mass-spring-damper system. It applies the TD3 algorithm to compare the performance of a traditional PID tuner with an RL-trained PID tuner, evaluated through simulations with step and constant inputs.
